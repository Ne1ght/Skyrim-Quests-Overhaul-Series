Civil War = More content with 3 stage plan to take over a hold 1. Preperations: a unique quest to sabotage or making the attack or defense of a fort easier/harder or even possible. 
Making used of mods that give each factions more soldiers. Finiesing with an actuall taking of each hold with dialog for the jarls. Solitude, Whiterun and Windhelm will be major battles.

Later a high king can be elected with resolutions for preperation for the second great war and rebuilding/making skyrim safer again.
Build Dark elf settelment at the world border of windhelm, argonien down the river to riften, orcs settelment at the border of falkreath, forsworn eradication or peace with building of settelment(No current spot found) and rebuilding winterhold.
Will be affected by the winning side and relation of the groups.

Giving of an thrid option for the dragonborn and whiterun to join the war for there own reasons, 
independance of skyrim / allowing the worship of talos / Thalmor and almerie dominion wont be allowed to enter skyrim but still keeping a denfsive or allience with the empire.
Making this the best outcome for all but this will be hard to archive as the dragonborn needs an army, Blades, dragons, companien and defectors of the other sides could join. 
The dragonborn can give or pay for the building of an orc settelment themself to make them join. First battle is an defensive one against both sides. That side will have more political manovers then the other sides. 
Will requrie that the main story is finished and like mass effect a amount of war assasts are present.

Also with the amount of casulties and damaged done to the oposing or own faction will worsen or lock ot certend options or making them harder to archive. 
Indrocutions of civil war deco with advanceing stages based on how far one side is pushed so no left over battle assest in whiterun when the war is pushed in its last stage.
