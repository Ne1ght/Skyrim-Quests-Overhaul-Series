Skyrim Main Quest Overhaul

Expanding the Role of the Dragon Cult
This overhaul brings greater focus to the Dragon Cult and its involvement with Alduin’s return. The Dragon Priests awaken as Alduin returns, leading to increased draugr activity and direct attacks on settlements, fulfilling Hadvar’s childhood nightmare (possibly a vision of the future) that he told the dragonborn about after helgen.
Hadvar and Ralof will become more involved with the Dragonborn, each representing their respective factions' interest in the rising dragon threat. Tullius and Ulfric take notice of the increasing draugr attacks and send them to investigate, leading to their involvement in key events. Because they are sort of left unused and only used for the civilwar though they are the first ones to aid the dragonborn so they should have more screentime and more depth of character.
Quest Progression Changes & Additions

1. From Helgen to the Dragonstone (Mostly unchanged)

The game progresses normally until the Dragonborn delivers the Dragonstone to Farengar in Dragonsreach.
Instead of immediately triggering the first dragon attack, 
Farengar examines the Dragonstone and finds that it marks dragon burial grounds and contains a note referencing the remnants of the Dragon Cult, 
who seek to aid Alduin.

2. Investigating the Dragon Cult

At this stage, the quest expands to include two new locations for investigation(Though A is the first one as the wodden mask will or is planned to be used to view the past without an elder scroll):

A. Labyrinthian (Dragonborn & Hadvar)
Farengar sends the Dragonborn to Labyrinthian to uncover more about the Dragon Cult.
Hadvar is sent by the Imperials to assist, as the Empire is now monitoring dragon activity.
Inside, the Dragonborn discovers the Wooden Mask and experiences a flashback vision, similar to using an Elder Scroll at the Time-Wound, revealing the Dragon Cult’s past plans and their connection to Alduin.
Returning to Farengar and Delphine, ~~the Dragonborn is now properly introduced to the Blades’ mission~~ (Breaks the first meeting so maybe not yet) and their concerns about the Thalmor. 
Delphine having heard that thalmor activiaty has increased in the rift and there being another importend connection to the acient dragon cult.

B. Riften (Dragonborn & Ralof)

The Dragonborn is sent to Riften to track down a Thalmor spy, who is disguised as a Stormcloak or Imperial officer.
Ralof, sent by the Stormcloaks, assists in uncovering the Thalmor’s secret mission as reports of missing soldiers in the rift have been found, and increasing dragaur acitivte, ralof being at helgen makes ulfric send him.
This leads to new clues about the Dragon Cult’s resurgence and a Thalmor connection to the dragons’ return or more so delphins supicons though the Thalmor are not rresponsible for it but they have another agander(Great war 2 mod?).

3. The First Dragon Attack & Whiterun's Role

After returning from Riften, Delphine receives news of a dragon sighting over Riverwood flying towards whiterun.
She and the Dragonborn pursue it, but arrive too late—the watchtower near Whiterun is already destroyed, with only one survivor left. Here the vanilla quest is used again/Return to dragonsreach and back down to fight the dragon with delphine going back to riverwood to look at the clues from the 3 previous dungeons.
This leads to the first dragon fight, where the Dragonborn absorbs a soul, triggering the Greybeards’ call. This leads to the vanilla quest again with the horn of jurgen windofer still being there but after that quest delphine conracts the dragonborn again through the corier.

4. The Greybeards & Expanding the Dragonborn's Power

After the dragon fight, the Greybeards summon the Dragonborn, marking the next phase of the story.
Delphine tries to prevent the Dragonborn from going, warning them not to blindly trust the Greybeards.
The Greybeards should unlock skill points or abilities for a Dragonborn Skill Tree during meditation (this can integrate existing skill mods).Paarthunax will them become the master rank teacher allowing the dragonborn to learn master level shouts like with the master ranked magic quests and teachers.

5. Kynesgrove Battle & Expanding the War Against the Dragons

The Kynesgrove dragon battle is expanded into a larger battle where NPCs die, making it a more impactful event. (To avoid quest breaking the named ones will survie but unnamed npcs and guards will be killed.)
Alduin not only revives Sahloknir but also raises draugr from the ground, forcing the player, Delphine, and others to fight both a dragon and an undead horde.
Ralof arrives to assist and permanently joins the Dragonborn’s journey from here. As Windhelm is right next to Kynesgrove. The player and ralof convince ulfric to let Ralof as Ulfric compairs it to the empire of old and there blades aiding someone with dragonsblood/ in this case soul.
After this event, dragons and draugr begin attacking towns and cities, marking the beginning of Skyrim’s open war against Alduin’s forces. (Named npcs cant be killed by inroducing a script that gives these atteking forces a keyword for not killing skyrim.esp and so ones npcs and only being allowed to kill ones from this mods esp file/or just killable npc keyword for SMQQ.esp npcs.)

6. The Blade's Growing Forces

After the incedent, the thalmor embassy quest happens to find out what the thalmor and there information network knows about dragons/findign esbern and going to the then blades hideout
before the Dragonborn reaches the Blades' hideoutand Ralof joins as a recruit. they see alduin flying towards roikstead making the group presue him
Hadvar joins as well after the Rorikstead dragon attack, since Alduin is seen flying there during the journey of the group.
Hadvar is stationed at Rorikstead due to increasing dragon and draugr attacks, part of the Empire’s attempt to protect Whiterun.
Expand the Blades Base with heartfire system and have more blades.

7. The Dragon Priests Must Fall

To weaken Alduin, the Dragon Priests must be killed to destroy the last believers who empower him.
Their masks may gain new importance, potentially unlocking more visions, hidden knowledge, or new Dragonborn abilities.
The Blades can now be rebuild and used without killing paxrthunax and they also help the dragonborn with killing the priests or defend villages/towns/holds.
If there can be randomly chosen/from a specific pool or hard codded needs to be thought of.

8. Next Phase: Alduin’s Wall

Idk maybe new animations or ai for dragon battles or alduin.
