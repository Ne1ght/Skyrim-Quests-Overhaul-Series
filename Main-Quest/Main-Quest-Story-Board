Skyrim Main Quest Overhaul

Expanding the Role of the Dragon Cult

This overhaul places greater emphasis on the Dragon Cult and its involvement in Alduin’s return.
As Alduin reawakens, the Dragon Priests also stir, leading to increased draugr activity and direct attacks on settlements—fulfilling Hadvar’s childhood nightmare (possibly a vision of the future) that he shares with the Dragonborn after Helgen.
(I think this is an interesting foreshadowing.)
Hadvar and Ralof will have a larger role, each representing their respective factions while providing more interaction with the Dragonborn and deeper insight into their goals.
Both Tullius and Ulfric take notice of the increasing draugr attacks and the incident in Helgen, where Alduin first appeared. 
In response, they send forces to investigate, leading to the establishment of outposts near dungeons where the Dragon Priests are awakening.
Ulfric, being a Nord, immediately recognizes Alduin, while General Ricke (I believe that was her name?) informs General Tullius. 
Consequently, both sides dispatch small groups of soldiers to contain the draugr threat and prevent civilians from wandering too close.
Since Ralof and Hadvar are primarily utilized for the Civil War, this mod will integrate them more prominently into the main quest, allowing them to aid the Dragonborn and receive more character development. 
Initially, they become involved when the Dragon Priests awaken and later accompany the Dragonborn to explore their resting places, also providing a way to bypass the military checkpoints mentioned earlier.

Quest Progression Changes & Additions

1. From Helgen to the Dragonstone (Mostly unchanged)

The game progresses normally until the Dragonborn delivers the Dragonstone to Farengar in Dragonsreach.
Instead of immediately triggering the first dragon attack, Farengar, with Delphine’s help, examines the Dragonstone and discovers that it not only marks dragon burial grounds (as in vanilla) but also the resting places of the Dragon Priests.
This revelation makes Delphine particularly interested in investigating two locations:
Labyrinthian, as it was the capital of the Dragon Cult.
A dungeon southeast of Riften, tied to that Thalmor agent and the remnants of the Dragon Cult.
Delphine asks the (not-yet-Dragonborn) player if they would be willing to investigate these places for her, for compansation of course.

2. Investigating the Dragon Cult

At this stage, the quest expands to include two new locations for investigation. (Although Labyrinthian should be tackled first due to the Wooden Mask mechanic, the player can choose the order, which will lead to new dialogue in the other location.)

A. Labyrinthian (Dragonborn & Hadvar)

Delphine sends the Dragonborn to Labyrinthian to uncover more about the Dragon Cult. 
Hadvar is sent by the Empire to assist, as they are now monitoring dragon activity. 
Since Hadvar survived Helgen, he is deemed a valuable asset, also having participated in preparatory missions during the Civil War (suggesting he is a skilled and important operative for Tullius).
Inside, the Dragonborn finds the Wooden Mask and experiences a flashback vision, similar to Varminas Daedric questline, revealing parts of the Dragon Cult’s past. (What it reveals is yet to be determined.)

B. Riften (Dragonborn & Ralof)

In Riften, the Dragonborn investigates the last stand of the Dragon Cult. Here, they meet Ralof, who is currently speaking with a Thalmor posing as a high-ranking Stormcloak officer. 
(A Thalmor agent disguising themselves as a Stormcloak doesn’t make much sense, but that was Bethesda’s idea, not mine.)
Ralof is suspicious of the Altmer but chooses to ignore it for now. The Dragonborn arrives in the middle of their conversation, triggering the vanilla quest to explore the dungeon. The only changes are Ralof’s presence and some additional dialogue.
After acquiring the Dragon Priest mask, the Wooden Mask (which now has a weight of 0 and cannot be removed from the inventory) begins glowing. A text box notifies the player, hinting that they should return to Labyrinthian to test it.
This interaction could function similarly to Vaermina’s Daedric quest, where the Dragonborn sees the past through the mask’s former owner(s).

3. The First Dragon Attack

After completing these investigations, the Dragonborn returns to Delphine, who pays them and begins analyzing the findings. As the Dragonborn leaves the Sleeping Giant Inn, a dragon can be heard and seen flying toward Whiterun. 
NPCs start commenting on it.
(Depending on whom the player followed in Helgen or helped using an alternate start mod, either Alvor or Ralof’s sister will speak to the player.)
The player heads to the Western Watchtower, only to find it destroyed, with a lone surviving Whiterun guard. Upon returning to Dragonsreach, the vanilla dragon battle proceeds as normal.
After slaying the dragon, the Greybeards summon the Dragonborn, marking the next phase of the story while allowing more time before fully embracing their destiny as Dragonborn—one of this mod’s main goals.

4. The Greybeards & Expanding the Dragonborn’s Power

The vanilla quest continues, with the Horn of Jurgen Windcaller still stolen by Delphine. (If using the “At Your Own Pace” mod, it should overwrite the vanilla quest as usual.)
The Greybeards now provide skill points or abilities for a Dragonborn Skill Tree during meditation. (This feature could be integrated with the existing Dragonborn Skill Tree mod for compatibility.)
Paarthurnax will act as the master-level teacher, allowing the Dragonborn to learn advanced shouts, similar to how master-level spells work with magic instructors.

5. Kynesgrove Battle & Alduin’s Growing Impact

The battle at Kynesgrove is significantly expanded. Instead of just reviving Sahloknir, Alduin also raises draugr, forcing the Dragonborn, Delphine, and others to fight both the dragon and an undead horde.
Ralof joins the battle, defending Kynesgrove’s people. (Perhaps he speaks to the Dragonborn first, or the vanilla NPC does—maybe both?)
After this event, dragon and draugr attacks on towns and cities increase. Soldiers begin fortifying Dragon Priest dungeons. Additionally, battlefields, burned settlements, and corpses appear throughout the world, growing more numerous as time passes.
(Important NPCs are protected via scripting so only generic NPCs can be killed.)

6. The Blades’ Growing Forces

After Kynesgrove, the Thalmor Embassy quest unfolds, this time with stronger justification—Delphine suspects the Thalmor’s involvement due to the agent in Riften, rather than purely out of personal bias.
Before reaching the Blades’ hideout, Ralof joins as a recruit. The group spots Alduin flying toward Rorikstead and pursues him, leading to an attack there.
Hadvar is stationed in Rorikstead, as the Empire is trying to protect Whiterun’s borders. His presence informs the Dragonborn that these attacks are increasing.
The Blades’ base can now be expanded using the Hearthfire system, allowing the Dragonborn to recruit more Blades and reinforce Skyrim’s defenses against dragon attacks.

7. The Dragon Priests Must Fall

At some point (either before or after Alduin’s defeat), it is revealed that the Dragon Priests must be killed to weaken Alduin.
Each mask grants a new flashback, and Konahrik’s Mask may play a crucial role in the final battle.

8. Next Phase: Alduin’s Wall

Potential improvements include new animations, AI behaviors for dragons, and enhanced battle mechanics for Alduin—though specific details are still in development.
