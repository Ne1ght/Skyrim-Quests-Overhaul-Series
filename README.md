# Skyrim-Quests-Overhaul-Series
For now thisisa drump for the story board for each quest, later when i got the hang of the creation kit and the coding langues i will work on the scripts to expand the quests. // For now a placeholder and inactive.

There are various requierments such as being a thane and more but that will be done in depth later on, first i need to actually learn the engine.

Planned:

Main Quest = Giving more focus on the actuall danger of the dragons and alduin. Ralof and Hadvar will be making more aperances, the dragonpriests and the dragoncult should have more of an presencs. The reveal of the Dragonborn will be pushed back while also introducing stakes of dead npcs (Will be unnamed ones introduced by the mod while making every npc not of this mod not killable by the attacks on towns/hold/villages). Using town/hold overhaul mods and world changing assests. Dragonborn skill tree mod by praying with the greybeards/Actuall rebuilding of the Blades.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Civil War = More content with 3 stage plan to take over a hold 1. Preperations: a unique quest to sabotage or making the attack or defense of a fort easier/harder or even possible. Making used of mods that give each factions more soldiers. Finiesing with an actuall taking of each hold with dialog for the jarls. Solitude, Whiterun and Windhelm will be major battles.

Later a high king can be elected with resolutions for preperation for the second great war and rebuilding/making skyrim safer again. Build Dark elf settelment at the world border of windhelm, argonien down the river to riften, orcs settelment at the border of falkreath, forsworn eradication or peace with building of settelment(No current spot found) and rebuilding winterhold. Will be affected by the winning side and relation of the groups.

Giving of an thrid option for the dragonborn and whiterun to join the war for there own reasons, independance of skyrim / allowing the worship of talos / Thalmor and almerie dominion wont be allowed to enter skyrim but still keeping a denfsive or allience with the empire. Making this the best outcome for all but this will be hard to archive as the dragonborn needs an army, Blades, dragons, companien and defectors of the other sides could join. The dragonborn can give or pay for the building of an orc settelment themself to make them join. First battle is an defensive one against both sides. That side will have more political manovers then the other sides. Will requrie that the main story is finished and like mass effect a amount of war assasts are present.

Also with the amount of casulties and damaged done to the oposing or own faction will worsen or lock ot certend options or making them harder to archive. Indrocutions of civil war deco with advanceing stages based on how far one side is pushed so no left over battle assest in whiterun when the war is pushed in its last stage.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Companion Overhault = Inroduction of the silver-hand as a splinter group when the companions first became werewolfs, resulution of destruction of the companions or rooting out hiricnesÂ´influence being farkas and vilkas being cured/ maybe alea and kotlak or there death. Needs new chracters and also compability for other mods.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thiefs guild = Better thiefing / Use good guys mod for a differant playthrough of the thiefs or help mijol destroy the thiefsguild, tack down mercer and still become a nightingale as an option with kalea and rebuild the thiefs guild as an better crime or coruption hunting guild. Also help Mijol and the jarl to destroy maven and her familiy
